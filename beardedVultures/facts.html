        <p>By now, you may have already read the front page facts about bearded vultures. Now, we can dive a little deeper into their lifestyle.</p>
        <p>You should already know this bird is unique for its one underlying quality. According to Wikipedia:</p>
        <blockquote>
            It usually disdains the actual meat and typically lives on 85-90% bones including bone marrow. <br>
            This is the only living bird species that specializes in feeding on bones. <br>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            3-4 feet long with a 7-9 foot wingspan, averaging about 13 pounds, the bearded vulture is like an upscaled falcon. They're mainly silent as well.

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>According to Wikipedia, 
            <q>The bearded vulture is sparsely distributed across a vast range. It occurs in mountainous regions[21] in the Pyrenees, 
            the Alps, the Arabian Peninsula, the Caucasus region, the Zagros Mountains and Alborz Mountains in Iran, the Koh-i-Baba in Bamyan, Afghanistan, 
            the Altai Mountains, the Himalayas, Ladakh in northern India, and western and central China.
            </q> It's also discoverable in Africa, like in the Atlas mountains. Basically, they like to live in mountainous regions. Pictured below is a picture of the Alps,

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>As mentioned previously, bearded vultures are scavengers that primarily eat bone. Chicks' diets might contain more meat though. Also mentioned previously was there habit 
            of dropping bones from large heights to break them into more digestible pieces. This is not an easy skill for them to learn; it can take up to 7 years for them
            to acquire the skill. Furthermore, bearded vultures also like to drop animals from great heights. These especially include tortoises and other small mammals.
